			<description>I applied to CrossOver last month. They have an automated interview process, where you have to pass a list of tests like basic cognitive aptitude and language skills.
It seemed like I passed all of the tests, however, after submitting my final test I heard that my score wasn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient to become a Product Knowledge Curator to earn that sweet American salary of $100K a year.
My final test consisted of creating three product knowledge articles based on customer inquiries.</description>

<p>My final test consisted of creating three product knowledge articles based on customer inquiries. I hope they can be treated as a good sample for anyone. Any feedback is welcome as well, as I have no experience with this sort of work, nor could I found any proper resources on the internet.</p>
<h1 id="article-1">Article #1</h1>
<h2 id="h" class="k8yr88jtekzq c7">Issue</h2>
<p>After installing Cloudflare, the usage of an IP address outside a
whitelisted range of IP addresses is unavailable. This happens, for
instance, in the case of downloading a data feed from the website of the
customer.</p>
<h2 id="h" class="keazvfit2kqd c7">Root cause</h2>
<p>The customer opened this ticket by announcing the installation of
Cloudflare. The Cloudflare product is known as a “Content Delivery
Network” (CDN). It’s main usage is serving static content, however,
customers also rely on it for <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205177068&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587533068987000">enhanced security, performance and
reliability</a>.</p>
<p>Cloudflare stops malicious traffic before it reaches the origin web
server; first, the origin IP address is “masked” (a DNS lookup returns a
Cloudflare IP address). The second step &ndash; our main concern &ndash; is
Cloudflare&rsquo;s’ analysis of the resources requested. If a visitor requests
a high volume of resources over a short period of time, then that
visitor can be marked as malicious traffic.</p>
<p>You can imagine that downloading a data feed in any interval might be
considered as suspicious and, subsequently, malicious traffic.
Whitelisting a range of IP addresses with server-defined firewall rules
marks traffic as unsuspicious. This is opposed to blacklisting a range
of IP addresses, in which case the server has a range of IP addresses
that are marked suspicious already and are therefore challenged or
blocked. In the Cloudflare configuration, both are known as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/217074967-Configuring-IP-Access-Rules&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587533068987000">configuring
IP access
rules</a>.
In IP access rules, visitors that are whitelisted have precedence over
blacklists.</p>
<p>We’ve agreed with the customer to download a data feed from their
website. Since it’s their website that’s using Cloudflare, they are
“privileged” (as in: having the rights of access) to configure
Cloudflare. Moreover, our role is to download their data feed, so we are
responsible for outbound traffic to their Cloudflare IP address. This
means that we have to supply our customer with a range of IP addresses
that they can use in their Cloudflare configuration.</p>
<p>We can supply this range of IP addresses by browsing to endpoint
<a href="https://api.crossover.com/12345678">https://api.crossover.com/12345678</a>. An API request to this endpoint
should return the IP addresses that should be whitelisted for use of
Cloudflare. This endpoint is secured with basic authentication. The
customer should have an application available for monitoring changes to
this file.</p>
<h2 id="h" class="glhs6ahcgeb8 c7">Resolution</h2>
<h3 id="h" class="9nh7dhmru0rk c14">Create a HTTP request to the endpoint</h3>

<h1 id="article-2">Article #2</h1>
<h2 id="h" class="k8yr88jtekzq c11">Issue</h2>
<p>The index for the fakesite.com fails. The customer is unable to update
the product catalog &ndash; one beneficiary of the index &ndash; which includes
pricing.</p>
<h2 id="h" class="keazvfit2kqd c11">Root cause</h2>
<p>Indexing is a common technique to decrease query time for a database. An
index is applied to rows with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-indexes.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587533093395000">specific columns to increase search
performance</a>.
If there’s no index available, then the database engine has to start a
query from the first row until it reaches the row that matches the
query. A query can also start the search from the index, decreasing the
query time to logarithmic time complexity (O(log(t)n)).</p>
<p>Fakesite.com has invested in a custom index by SLI
(com.sli.searchbuilder), a Java application. This index fails because it
“expects single but array was returned”. Specifically, there’s one entry
that has duplicated &lt;review&gt; information. In other words, there’s one
item number “24140-206” that has two entry keys: “826” and “1987”. We
can reproduce the error by returning an array [“826”, “1987”].</p>
<p>It’s possible to specify two keys because there’s an issue with the
translation module. This module is called by the previously mentioned
SearchBuilder module. The first function in the call stack is the
setVariables function by the TranslationFunction module. Let’s assume
that this function takes the database entry (row) as input, and returns
a Java data structure. It throws an error, then, because the variable
for product reviews keys should be a single and not an array.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as documented in the original troubleshooting article,
there’s not enough information about the location of the Select One From
Array Module. This module could handle an array as input by selecting
one value in that array instead of the array itself. We can’t locate
this module because it’s “Use If” has multiple connections. It has
multiple connections because the original software engineer has chosen
for this implementation for various reasons that are outside of the
scope of this article.</p>
<p>We could resolve the solution permanently by modifying this function and
wrap the present logic in a conditional logic block. We might be able to
check the parameters for the presence of an array of keys instead. In a
quick patch, we could take the first item in the array by default; this
might be the first product review written.</p>
<p>In a rewrite, which should take longer and have customer approval, we
should either build the application to support multiple product reviews
or deny any attempt at entering multiple product reviews. This will
prevent the issue mentioned in this article to happen again.</p>

<h1 id="article-3">Article #3</h1>
<h2 id="h" class="k8yr88jtekzq c8">Issue</h2>
<p>The customer has reported a high memory footprint on the LGP server.</p>
<h2 id="h" class="keazvfit2kqd c8">Root cause</h2>
<p>A customer has opened a ticket as a follow-up to a previous request
(#1117416 &ndash; “Memory up to 98 percent on LGP server”). The previous
request has not been adequately satisfied, ie. there’s still no
temporary or permanent resolution for the memory usage on the LGP
server.</p>
<p>There’s not enough information to conclude that the problem resolved
itself automatically previous time, and hence no intervention by the L1
or L2 was necessary. However, it seems likely that the problem has
resolved itself by nature of memory. That’s because with 98%+ usage, the
process might have been OOM-killed. There is only data available from
day-by-day, so we don’t know the actual memory usage on a given day.
This is obviously a report run by the sar command, so next time it might
be more useful to report on real-time metrics.</p>
<p>Let’s not assume that understanding one metric, memory usage, is key to
diagnosing the problem. One distinction we can’t infer from this table
is the respective virtual and physical memory. Moreover, we have no
information about what application is responsible for which part of the
memory. If this is a case of virtual memory over-allocation, we could
tune that behavior. Another matter is the difference between active and
inactive memory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there’s no indication that there is actually problem. It
looks like there’s efficient use of memory if we don’t know the
respective resident memory and cache sizes. There has not been any
report of system failure. It might be a good idea to do some further
reporting to assess whether there’s an issue, and if so, what we might
provide as resolution for the customer request.</p>
<h2 id="h" class="glhs6ahcgeb8 c8">Resolution</h2>
<h3 id="h" class="2epbdqtnj7hp c15">In-depth reporting</h3>
<p>Please run:</p>
<ul>
<li>free</li>
<li>cat /proc/meminfo</li>
<li>vmstat 1 3 5</li>
<li>top</li>
<li>ps -eo pid,user,comm,size,vsize,rss</li>
<li>sar -r 1 3 5</li>
<li>sar -S 1 3 5</li>
<li>smem</li>
</ul>
<p>And report the results, so we can get more information about this issue.
We should also keep the customer up-to-date on this issue.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When hiring for DevOps Engineers, it&rsquo;s generally suggested that hiring one or more DevOps Engineers will not change the organizational blueprint. Meaning, hiring DevOps Engineers will not get all the alleged benefits described by high performing organizations like Netflix or in the DevOps Handbook.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s partially true, however, we can make the first step in the right direction. Specifically, we can start with Flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flow accelerates the delivery of work from Development to Operations to our customers. (DevOps Handbook, part I introduction)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I want to do in this article series is reason about the theory and principles of DevOps, then find out how that would look like in a concrete implementation. I&rsquo;m trying to bridge the gap between all the marketing lingo on the one hand, and the groundworks of excellent engineers on the other, to make the underpinnings accessible to all.</p>
<p>I think one good way to do that would be to use general-purpose tools so we can think about the design instead of pulling solutions off-the-shelve. Then we can discover on our own what the best implementation would be for an organization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, implementing Flow is supposed to be the stepping stone to the principle of Feedback, after which we can make the step to Continual Learning and Experimentation, coming full circle with the Three Ways of Flow, Feedback, and Continual Learning and Experimentation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to limit the scope to Kubernetes and AWS. So why would we use Kubernetes and AWS, specifically in that combination? First of all, they are the &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; industry standard platforms. Kubernetes is like an operating system on steroids. As a standard, it provides a common interface for networking, security, storage, etc.</p>
<p>Kubernetes needs an environment to run in, and that&rsquo;s where we use AWS. AWS has provided the community with interfaces to their platform through an API and development SDKs. Consequently, in combination with AWS having market leader status, there are loads of useful tools to communicate with the platform. Combine the extensibility of these two tools, and you have an environment that&rsquo;s reliable, consistent, scalable, cost-effective, well-maintained, secure and performant, among other things.</p>
<p>Now, we only need two more tools to glue Kubernetes and AWS together. The first one is Terraform, which we can use to provision the environment Kubernetes needs to run in by using AWS resources. Secondly, we use Ansible to provide configuration management for the provisioned machines so Kubernetes has all the resources it needs.</p>
<p>All the additional tools we need have an interface to Ansible, either through the front through Ansible Modules, or through the back by tools that call Ansible for build, deploy and test steps, such as Make and Travis CI.</p>
<p>In the next article, we&rsquo;ll build a deployment pipeline using Ansible. Next, we discuss continuous delivery, and we&rsquo;ll use our pipeline to deploy into Kubernetes. Subsequently, we discuss infrastructure as code and we&rsquo;ll describe our environment as code in Terraform. When we&rsquo;re done with that, we discuss Feedback, and we can start building on top of Kubernetes and discover topics like ingress, logging, monitoring, application lifecycle management, networking, storage, security, among other things. Finally, we discuss Continual Learning and Experimentation, and build our own tools.</p>
<p>All the code will be open-source on Github, so you can replicate the code if you have a small organization and would like to start cost-effectively with Kubernetes and AWS. In this article series, we&rsquo;ll be going through the implementation step-by-step, so you&rsquo;ll have the understanding to build something on your own.</p>
<h1 id="continuous-integration-with-ansible-and-co">Continuous integration with Ansible and co.</h1>
<p>We start with continuous integration (&ldquo;CI&rdquo;). &ldquo;Doing CI&rdquo; can be explained as applying Agile principles to infrastructure as opposed to application code. We can also define CI by its underpinning, the Lean Manufacturing principles, as a technology value stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In DevOps, we typically define our technology value stream as the process required to convert a business hypothesis into a technology-enabled service that delivers value to the customer. (DevOps Handbook, part I)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recognize this concept by its Development variant: Scrum, user stories, Kanban, feature specifications, etc., implemented as the application or service being built. More importantly, the application will only be producing value once it&rsquo;s running in production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because value is created only when our services are running in production, we must ensure that we are not only delivering fast flow, but that our deployments can also be performed without causing chaos and disruptions such as service outages, service impairments, or security or compliance failures. (DevOps Handbook, part I)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This subset of the technology value stream is known as the &ldquo;deployment lead time&rdquo; which can be described as the focus of DevOps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This value stream begins when any engineer in our value stream (which includes Development, QA, IT Operations, and Infosec) checks a change into version control and ends when that change is successfully running in production, providing value to the customer and generating useful feedback and telemetry. (DevOps Handbook, part I)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast, the second phase of work, which includes Testing and Operations, is akin to Lean Manufacturing. It requires creativity and expertise, and strives to be predictable and mechanistic, with the goal of achieving work outputs with minimized variability (e.g., short and predictable lead times, near zero defects). (DevOps Handbook, part I)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is not one correct way to shorten the deployment lead time. As long as it shortens from whatever timeframe it is now &ndash; allegedly months or quarters for some organizations &ndash; to under 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Concretely, I think that the best option right now is to use and collaborate on open-source tools to create the most optimal solution for the organization at hand. I have my own set of tools that I prefer and I&rsquo;d like to demonstrate why, of course with respect to other solutions that are also possible. As you might have guessed, for me that&rsquo;s Ansible, and I&rsquo;ll show you why in the next article, where we&rsquo;re going to dive into the implementation.</p>

			<title>Thoughts On The CNCF CKA Exam After Passing With 93%</title>

			<description>Last month I passed the CNCF CKA exam. I&amp;rsquo;ve been postponing the exam date for the better part of the year, assuming that it would be a very difficult exam. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve read, it used to be a difficult exam up until they broke the exam into two parts: CKA and CKAD. This happened around two years ago.
The CKA is supposed to be the more difficult one of the two exams.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month I passed the CNCF CKA exam. I&rsquo;ve been postponing the exam date for the better part of the year, assuming that it would be a very difficult exam. From what I&rsquo;ve read, it used to be a difficult exam up until they broke the exam into two parts: CKA and CKAD. This happened around two years ago.</p>
<p>The CKA is supposed to be the more difficult one of the two exams. <a href="https://svatwork.com/posts/yet-another-cka-study-guide/">I&rsquo;ve written a guide on how to study for the CKA</a>. Yet that&rsquo;s not what I experienced, and I&rsquo;d like to tell you why.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-going-to-be-on-the-test">What Is Going To Be On The Test</h2>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s the skill of test taking. I remember during university studying law that some of my peers would be able to score high grades easily by only reading the summaries, while I was stuck in the library 24/7 for weeks before the exams. Little did I know, they aren&rsquo;t so much excellent lawyers as they are excellent test takers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/253203.How_to_Become_a_Straight_A_Student">There&rsquo;s a good introductory book on test taking by Cal Newport</a>. It&rsquo;s introductory because I think this only discusses the idea of how to learn. But the most important part is more about intuition of what&rsquo;s going to be on the test. Ideally, at one point you have a lightbulb flashing like the moment you master a new programming concept, to understand that only 5% of the course content is going to be on a final test. Perhaps one of the reasons is that creating a comprehensive test for a test (at least in university) is an administrative burden.</p>
<p>When you see this pattern, that all tests are created in equal fashion, you&rsquo;re Neo in the Matrix. Now you know what&rsquo;s going to be on the test, expect to have a score of at least 70% dedicated to knowing what to study. If you have a low aptitude for test taking and inherent lazyness like me, it&rsquo;s enough to coast school and end up with the 60.000$ paper bill that says I passed some tests. The remaining 30% is moulding your answers to the teacher&rsquo;s preference.</p>
<p>The tests in beta sciences are also predictable. But the tests are more difficult, since you need more room to build up concepts in your mind. An example would be C pointers: you can&rsquo;t understand pointers without understanding functions; you can&rsquo;t understand function without understanding variables, etc. So you can imagine concepts stacked on top of each other, where each new layer requires understanding of the previous layer.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s view this in the light of the CKA exam. In the study guide I outlined the syllabus, where each concept you have to know for the test had some resources to understand that topic. But that&rsquo;s not going to be on the test: there&rsquo;s too much information. KodeKloud comes to the rescue, because it will help you study for the test and not for Kubernetes in particular. I consider this a 40$ well-spent; then again, I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it proves anything about one&rsquo;s understanding of Kubernetes. Maybe I&rsquo;m too hard on the CKA; it&rsquo;s the only way to measure aptitude for kubectl at scale, which will definitely weed out some people that feign understanding.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-dont-i-have-100">So Why Don&rsquo;t I Have 100%?</h2>
<p>Yes, in all my arrogance, I should have at least a score of 100%. Unfortunately, I spent about 1.5h of the exam on one question about DNS which I eventually didn&rsquo;t pass. So even if you get the tip to &ldquo;read the questions well&rdquo;, the questions might be phrased in such a way that it doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I had to perform a successful nslookup, but they didn&rsquo;t specify which host that&rsquo;s supposed to be. So it could be either localhost, one of the nodes, or one of the pods. I could do it successfully from the pod, but that didn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense, since it was my understanding that something was broken. So I spent all my time trying to make DNS work from the localhost; trying to copy over the /etc/hosts from the kube-proxy or whatever. Obviously, the questions aren&rsquo;t that deep and you might find yourself in a situation where you break the cluster more easily than follow the question.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>I think these two points cover what I found lacking in other resources. For other tips, I think there are enough in the previous article. So how about this: you passed the Kubernetes exam. What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I recently found myself in a discussion on Facebook about Kubernetes and what to study after understanding the basics of Kubernetes. Someone asked me what they should do to get into more advanced Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s kind of interesting, because why would anyone learn Kubernetes if it isn&rsquo;t for the benefits that come after the hard time of understanding this technology? Should you learn Kubernetes just for the sake of Kubernetes, or do you now have a very nice and universal hammer at your disposal? I think it&rsquo;s the latter, and I noticed learning Kubernetes is that all the IT concepts have their own place in the Kubernetes ecosystem. For example, the NGINX webserver is one of the most popular pods to deploy in the cluster as it serves the same purpose as with previous machines.</p>
<p>So what you could do to get into more advanced Kubernetes, is pick a topic that you find interesting, like security, networking, operating systems, AI, web development, etc. Anything that could be run on a distributed framework. Then explore that topic in the context of Kubernetes. I replied that I&rsquo;d like to explore web development, as a gateway to be able to launch MVP&rsquo;s when I feel ready for entrepreneurship. So for me it&rsquo;s logical to run my web stacks on Kubernetes, and learn about Kubernetes in that context in the process.</p>

			<title>What Lessons Did I Learn In My Career So Far</title>

			<description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started doing freelance cloud engineering since the end of 2018. During software engineering at my first full-time employer, I was invited to work on a start-up. At one point the money ran out, so I went to look for a new employer in 2019. There, I worked on system administration during the time DevOps and Cloud were becoming trending.
I took a break for a while to travel, and had some time to think about what direction to head.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve started doing freelance cloud engineering since the end of 2018. During software engineering at my first full-time employer, I was invited to work on a start-up. At one point the money ran out, so I went to look for a new employer in 2019. There, I worked on system administration during the time DevOps and Cloud were becoming trending.</p>
<p>I took a break for a while to travel, and had some time to think about what direction to head. I think it&rsquo;s a good practice to think about the direction you want to go in before you put in the work, because you can get anywhere you want but you might end up somewhere you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Now, in April 2020, I feel comfortable going into cloud engineering knowing that it&rsquo;s the right choice for the upcoming years.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a recap of my project experience:</p>
<h2 id="software-engineer-at-ellips">Software Engineer at Ellips</h2>
<p>It was quite exciting getting hired as a software engineer since I majored in law and did computer science on the side. Nevertheless, my C++ implementation of binary search was enough to have them excited as well. The projects I worked on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working in Agile Scrum;</li>
<li>Writing C# front-end in a model-view-controller pattern;</li>
<li>Writing C++/Lua (computer vision) back-end;</li>
<li>Automated deployment of TFS build agents.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-architect-at-hydrotronics">Data Architect at Hydrotronics</h2>
<p>Hydrotronics had an interesting proposition as a B2B SaaS provider with spa automation back-end. I also got back into consulting after failing running a company two years ago.</p>
<p>For this project, I would be in charge of data engineering on AWS. We worked in a team of five; everyone had loads of experience and high expectations of me. Moreover, there were technical barriers between the team members since everyone knew their own niche well but it was hard to figure out how one part would fit in the other.</p>
<p>If we could repeat the project, I would bargain for getting investments before developing the product. Then it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary to pay for the development of the product out-of-pocket. Establishing product/market fit before developing the project is a great way to attract capital. In the end, the assumption that this model would sell itself was only the &ldquo;logical conclusion&rdquo; of how much this product would be in demand. Needless to say, a better way would have been to base that decision on data.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, the project didn&rsquo;t work out for me but it&rsquo;s great knowing I was an asset in the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making the architectural design for data engineering on AWS;</li>
<li>Successfully applying for the Dutch subsidy grant for innovation;</li>
<li>Financial data modelling for attracting capital.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="systems-engineer-at-acc-ict">Systems Engineer at ACC ICT</h2>
<p>In May 2019 I was desperate for money. I was still doing a breadth-first-search of sorts, where I would rather learn wide knowledge rather than deep knowledge. So after working at an enterprise shop and a start-up, doing a whole other aspect of IT called &ldquo;system administration&rdquo; seemed quite interesting. Furthermore, after keeping up with studies I began to feel more comfortable writing code and making decisions. You could tell by the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>CI/CD implementation in Jenkins/Ansible for configuring Kubernetes clusters;</li>
<li>CI/CD implementation in Jenkins/Ansible for deploying microservices.</li>
</ul>
<p>I figured that as a private cloud provider with WYSIWYG Kubernetes clusters, there should at least be automation in place so we could roll out Kubernetes clusters in a decent amount of time. It would be a strange proposition to perform these manually, since there are loads of cloud offering where you can roll out your own cluster with a few clicks.</p>
<h2 id="taking-a-break">Taking A Break</h2>
<p>For my break starting in December 2019, I flew to Tasmania. I&rsquo;ve explored the island and that was enough Australia for me. I spent a month in Bali where I studied for AWS CCP (besides having fun of course).</p>
<p>Now, I knew that I wanted to come back to Hanoi because two years ago when I studied CS in Singapore I spent some time in Vietnam. So it seemed like the perfect choice, and I flew to Hanoi in February. I was planning to start teaching English, but those plans have been cut short for now due to the Corona virus. At least while sitting at home, I had time to study and achieve the CNCF CKA.</p>
<h2 id="company-attempt-number-three">Company Attempt Number Three</h2>
<p>In January 2020 I also registered the company &ldquo;sv@work&rdquo; in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. In the next two months, I signed on two clients who were my previous employers. One employer is ACC ICT and the other is a law firm specializing in health care law.</p>
<p>It took me until April to realize, after studying about freelancing and entrepreneurship, that it&rsquo;s quite important to select a niche. You see, people only think about other people in terms of their top capability. Like in medieval times, you know Joe is a proper blacksmith and Maria does excellent clothes repair.</p>
<p>Besides that, to actually help a client you should already have the solution in place. The idea is to know one solution so well, you could perform it with your eyes closed. (This solution should of course have product/market fit, ie. there&rsquo;s a clear demand for this kind of solution. This lack of information is probably the hardest part about proper execution of a starting company. Now for me, as a developer, there shouldn&rsquo;t be a lack of demand for cloud engineering solutions.)</p>
<p>This is one of my mistakes for this year. I assumed that it would be enough to sell a client on my time. But no, you can only help a client with some arbitrary problem if and only if you have a system in place for solving that problem.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume you know one solution well. The next step would be to find your clients: where are they? Obviously, in the digital era it&rsquo;s become easier to match supply and demand. Let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re on an arbitrary social media platform.</p>
<p>We want to have a conversation with those people; now for me, this is where the focus will be in 2020. As an employer, you&rsquo;d ideally have contractors that have their area of expertise with the lowest possible risk to execute on the company vision. For me, there&rsquo;s a lack of demonstrating that value, so I might have to go find a job after all. I found out about this while doing some interviews for contracting positions.</p>
<p>Anyway, while I find a solution to pay the bills, in the meantime, if I want to succeed as a freelancer, I should demonstrate value by writing articles about my technology stack and subsequent projects.</p>

			<description>As of March 2020 there are loads of resources to study for CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator). A lot of people have compiled their tips and tricks, created exercise repositories and applications, compiled yet more lists of additional resources, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute by sharing my resource list. This is not my original work, and you will find all sources in the &amp;ldquo;Source index&amp;rdquo; paragraph. I&amp;rsquo;ve scheduled the test for next month and I&amp;rsquo;ll report later to share my own opinion about the test, if there&amp;rsquo;s anything I can contribute.</description>

<p>Learn to create the Kubernetes objects FAST</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a small amount of knowledge of how to SysAdmin a Kubernetes cluster</p>

<li>
<p>Use the docs site search functionality. A lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritise your questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the command line kubectl explain will help you during the exam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully study the topic of</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/static-pod/">Static Pods</a>, this will help you very well when troubleshooting the non-working Kubernetes components.</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/">TLS Bootstrapping</a>. From my point of view the most voluminous question on the exam. It seemed to me more difficult than Mumshad described in his course and in the practical tests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;If you don’t have specific knowledge about container tecnologies and docker, read the O’Reilly’s book “<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036142.do">Docker: Up &amp; Running</a>“, the exam doesn’t require specific knowledge about docker but, since Kubernetes is an orchestrator for containers, this is a needed base.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;IMHO the best book about k8s is “<strong><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action">Kubernetes in Action</a></strong>” , it covers a lot of aspect about this software and it’s very detailed, you don’t need to read it from the beginning till the end, some chapters of the “part 3” are not required by the exam.&rdquo;</p>

<li><a href="http://kubernetes.io">kubernetes.io</a> (&ldquo;Ensure you have the right version of Kubernetes documentation selected (e.g. v1.16 as of 20th Nov. 2019 exam) especially for API objects and annotations. This release removes several deprecated API&rsquo;s.&quot;)</li>
