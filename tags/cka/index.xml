      <description>Last month I passed the CNCF CKA exam. I&amp;rsquo;ve been postponing the exam date for the better part of the year, assuming that it would be a very difficult exam. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve read, it used to be a difficult exam up until they broke the exam into two parts: CKA and CKAD. This happened around two years ago.
The CKA is supposed to be the more difficult one of the two exams.</description>

      <description>As of March 2020 there are loads of resources to study for CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator). A lot of people have compiled their tips and tricks, created exercise repositories and applications, compiled yet more lists of additional resources, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute by sharing my resource list. This is not my original work, and you will find all sources in the &amp;ldquo;Source index&amp;rdquo; paragraph. I&amp;rsquo;ve scheduled the test for next month and I&amp;rsquo;ll report later to share my own opinion about the test, if there&amp;rsquo;s anything I can contribute.</description>
