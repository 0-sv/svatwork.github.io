      <description>Last month I participated in the AWS interview. I passed the interview with the submission of an hypothetical assignment as a Solutions Architect. I did not proceed with the next round as I wanted to finish my year here in Hanoi.
Have a look: https://svatwork.github.io/aws-sa-interview/index.html.</description>

      <description>When hiring for DevOps Engineers, it&amp;rsquo;s generally suggested that hiring one or more DevOps Engineers will not change the organizational blueprint. Meaning, hiring DevOps Engineers will not get all the alleged benefits described by high performing organizations like Netflix or in the DevOps Handbook.
I think that&amp;rsquo;s partially true, however, we can make the first step in the right direction. Specifically, we can start with Flow.
 Flow accelerates the delivery of work from Development to Operations to our customers.</description>
