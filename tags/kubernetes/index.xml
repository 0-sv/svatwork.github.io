      <description>When hiring for DevOps Engineers, it&amp;rsquo;s generally suggested that hiring one or more DevOps Engineers will not change the organizational blueprint. Meaning, hiring DevOps Engineers will not get all the alleged benefits described by high performing organizations like Netflix or in the DevOps Handbook.
I think that&amp;rsquo;s partially true, however, we can make the first step in the right direction. Specifically, we can start with Flow.
 Flow accelerates the delivery of work from Development to Operations to our customers.</description>

      <title>Thoughts On The CNCF CKA Exam After Passing With 93%</title>

      <description>Last month I passed the CNCF CKA exam. I&amp;rsquo;ve been postponing the exam date for the better part of the year, assuming that it would be a very difficult exam. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve read, it used to be a difficult exam up until they broke the exam into two parts: CKA and CKAD. This happened around two years ago.
The CKA is supposed to be the more difficult one of the two exams.</description>

      <description>As of March 2020 there are loads of resources to study for CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator). A lot of people have compiled their tips and tricks, created exercise repositories and applications, compiled yet more lists of additional resources, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute by sharing my resource list. This is not my original work, and you will find all sources in the &amp;ldquo;Source index&amp;rdquo; paragraph. I&amp;rsquo;ve scheduled the test for next month and I&amp;rsquo;ll report later to share my own opinion about the test, if there&amp;rsquo;s anything I can contribute.</description>
