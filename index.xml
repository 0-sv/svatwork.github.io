      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started doing freelance cloud engineering since the end of 2018. During software engineering at my first full-time employer, I was invited to work on a start-up. At one point the money ran out, so I went to look for a new employer in 2019. There, I worked on system administration during the time DevOps and Cloud were becoming trending.
I took a break for a while to travel, and had some time to think about what direction to head.</description>

      <description>As of March 2020 there are loads of resources to study for CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator). A lot of people have compiled their tips and tricks, created exercise repositories and applications, compiled yet more lists of additional resources, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute by sharing my resource list. This is not my original work, and you will find all sources in the &amp;ldquo;Source index&amp;rdquo; paragraph. I&amp;rsquo;ve scheduled the test for next month and I&amp;rsquo;ll report later to share my own opinion about the test, if there&amp;rsquo;s anything I can contribute.</description>
